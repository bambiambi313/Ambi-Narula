      <h2>A Look into UMD Comedy Groups </h2>
      <h4>By Ambi Narula</h4>
      <!--This is my article. it includes links to each of the comedy groups that have websites -->
      <p>
        The University of Maryland, College Park has always been known for its diversity, but something the community may not know about as much is it’s several unique comedy groups. At the moment there are 5 groups on campus, each with their own
        structure, traditions, and style of humor.

        In 1986, <a href="http://www.erasable-inc.com/">Erasable Inc.</a> was founded with the help of Yale’s improv group Purple Crayon. “Inc.” for short, it is the only all-improv group on campus, offering a variety of performances in Long and
        Short form improv.

        “Improv is different from any other style of comedy. Anything can happen,” said Stephaine Moy, a current member.

        During its performances, which occur every Friday from 1-2 p.m. on the steps of McKeldin Library, Inc. takes suggestions from the audience and uses them as inspiration for its scenes. Depending on the two people in a scene, a specific type of
        humor develops.

        In 1996, <a href="https://www.sketchupcomedy.com/">Sketchup</a> was formed to create its own production of only skit or “sketch” styled shows on campus, providing audiences a mix of different humor styles and short punchlines.

        “When I first auditioned for Sketchup it was just for fun, but once I went through the first round of auditions, I fell in love with it. I could tell that it was something I wanted to do and a group of people I wanted to be around,” said
        Grace Chubb, a current member.

        Students constantly work on re-writing and re-conceptualizing sketches–its specialized form of comedy. Because of the nature of its rehearsal process, it performs one big show every semester including all 16 members.

        The Bureau was founded in 2005 bringing in an interesting addition to the comedy circle. The Bureau is UMD co-ed all-purpose comedy group; performing in stand up, improv and sketch comedy.

        “The Bureau brings something different to the table. We’re the only co-ed group that accepts seniors and also the only group that performs in regional shows and competitions around the DMV area,” said Alex Parsly, a current member.

        The Bureau performs several times throughout the semester, including two improv shows, one sketch show, and festivals at other colleges. It targets all types of humor, but many times its material can be slightly darker than other groups on
        campus.

        In 2019, two new comedy groups emerged into the mix:<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mdnightlive/">Maryland Night Live</a> a Saturday Night Live-styled show, and The Hysterics, UMD’s all-female comedy group.

        Maryland Night Live has currently put on 4 shows since last spring. It brought a new environment to the comedy scene allowing students in different groups to join forces in a new entertainment show format.

        “We’re something beyond the typical college comedy group. We’re more professional similarly to SNL and our past shows reflect that. If it’s an MNL production you’re watching, you know it's going to be the best,” said Walker Green, co-founder,
        and producer.

        Maryland Night Live takes 6 weeks to produce one show. Within those 6 weeks, students take 3 weeks to write and rewrite sketches and 3 weeks of rehearsals with a cast of 15 to 20 members. Maryland Night Live also provides its own jazz band
        and 2 musical guests just as an SNL show.

        The Hysterics created a new space for female-identifying comedians to practice stand-up sets, improv, and write sketches, to promote women in comedy around campus.

        “I think this group will help other female comedians and performers build up the confidence to perform on stage,” said Rachel Niswander, a current member.

        The Hysterics fosters an environment for students who identify as females to be around other women, network, grow their comedy skills. Thus far they performed stand up and UCB improv inspired styled shows and hope to expand into sketch
        writing and performances. The Hysterics are the only group to have gained mentorship from well-known comedians: Nikki Glaser and Lisa Best. Giving them the opportunity to open for Nikki Glaser at the DC improv this past November.

        University of Maryland, College Park comedy scene has grown into a little community of over 60 students trying to provide entertainment to their peers. Every group has talented members and many of them are on their way to becoming the next
        big star in the comedy world.
